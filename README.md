## What is it?

Experimenting with your own LEGO-Based Setup is fun and easy! ðŸŽ‰

The LEGO-based setup has the advantage that you can assemble different types of components at will within the board base.

Instead of building huge setups every time you need to test new boards, motors, or encoders, just design and print your own LEGO-based components.
